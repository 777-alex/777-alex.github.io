    <h1>About Me, Alex</h1>
  </header>

  <p class="body-about">Hello there! I'm Alex, a Graphic Designer based out of the Washington D.C. area. I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a BFA in Graphic Design. Ever since I began interning in my sophomore year
    of college, design always has revolved around the audience for me. The reason for that is simple: I am not designing for myself 99% of the time, at the end of the day, I am creating something for you; The person reading this, the person who will
    see the final product and interact with it in some form.<br><br>Design to me means being able to create the experience for consumers. Create for them and always keep them in mind. My process for design is research, ideate, test, refine, and
    repeat. By testing on actual users and refining your work based on the feedback, you end up truly creating an experience thatâ€™s tailored to them and creating happier users for the product. <br><br>Outside of design, I enjoy many things! I watch
    Seinfeld as often as I can, traveling, and singing along off-key to the music in my car. I'm trying to get back into reading again, so any book recommendations would be great! <br><br>Check out my VSCO & Instagram to see some photos from my
    travels!</p>
