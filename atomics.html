    <h1>ATOMICS</h1>
    <p>ATOMICS is a dashboard which allows what were once all separate links within AbbVie's intranet to live in one simple hub. This project arose from an ever-growing amount of shortcuts being made and not being aware of what tools were actually
      available to this specific team. After determining the pain points, I opted that creating a hub with descriptions, and allowing the user to pin their frequently used apps would benefit them greatly. As the team I work with is all developers, I
      led design. With wireframing and early research done on paper and pen, I then transferred my designs into Figma for prototyping and further fleshed-out my ideas from my early drafts. As a result of this project, more divisions within AbbVie
      have asked to use the framework that I designed so they can use it for a similar manner, so what started as a small project for a specific team is now being adopted by different teams that heard of this project through word of mouth.</p>
